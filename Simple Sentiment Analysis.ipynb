to population aging, an imbalance in the population age structure.\n","[134]Because of the global decline in the fertility rate, projections of future global population show a marked slowing of population growth and the possibility of long-term decline.\n","Under their projections, during the period 2045–2050, Europe's population will be in decline and all other regions will experience significant reductions in growth; then, by the end of the 21st century (the period 2095–2100) three of these regions will be showing population decline and global population will have peaked and
